## Main features 

### Booking an EveRide

While navigating to the 'Everide it now', it will detect your current location. Then user can search for the place that he/she intended to go (Google Places API). Lastly, based on the distance travelled, it will calculate the total fees.

### Ride experience
It will search for the nearest driver. Once the driver is found, the markers will mimic the process of the driver picking up and dropping off the user.

E-wallet and rewarding system using CF (Carbon Footprint) value. The CF is calculated by the total distance travelled.
